## Status
In dev.

## Description
This project aims to find XSS vulnerabilities. It uses `selenium` to interact with a chrome driver, and thus obtain all the data and detect whether an alert can be triggered with certain payloads. A request bin is also embeded in this project, which is very useful to steal cookies for example. To be sure that this tool works at all, I've tested it on multiple Root-me challenges that I have solved before.
