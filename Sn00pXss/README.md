## Status
In dev (beginning).

## Description
This project aims to find XSS vulnerabilities. It uses `selenium` to interact with a chrome driver, and thus obtain all the data and detect whether an alert can be triggered with certain payloads. A request bin is also embeded in this project, which is very useful to steal cookies for example.
